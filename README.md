1. create your own resume data in JSON format
2. For the above JSON, iterate over all for loops 1) For 2) For in 3) For of 4) ForEach

It is not possible to iterate over the entire json with a single for loop type.
Hence, I've combined for loop types 1,4 and 2,3 based on the necessity and compatibility,
such as the "for in" loop is used for arrays inside the json structure and cannot be used for
the JSON structure itself.
